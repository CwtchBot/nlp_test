	Previously, she could have up to a month episode free, but now she is having episodes most days.  She will have between 0-3 episodes a day. - 181 - none of these picked up.
refractory focal epilepsy presenting with partial seizures with secondary generalised tonic clonic seizures - 183 - seizure types not picked up
